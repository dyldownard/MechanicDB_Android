## MechanicDB - Web
MechanicDB is an application ecosystem designed to help home mechanics document work on their vehicles.

We set up an ecosystem that allows our applications to share the same database of vehicle and maintainence records so that you can view, add, edit or delete records from whatever device is most convenient to you.

# Web
MechanicDB_Android is the Android version of MechanicDB. It is built using Kotlin, and maintains your data locally using Room so that you can view records regardless of internet connectivity.
